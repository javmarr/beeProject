# Bee Detection Project
The purpose of this project is to be able to detect bees in an image regardless or orientation (vertical, diagonal, horizontal and anything in-between)

# Tools:
 - OpenCV library:
 ...image processing
 ...toring matricies
 ...performing matrix computations (finding the covarience, matrix transpose, principal component analysis, etc)
 - Custom cropping tool:
 ...We created our cropping tool in order to generate the sample images from a given video file
