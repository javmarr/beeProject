## OpenCV
Mainly used for image processing, storing matricies, performing matrix operations  such as finding the covarience of a matrix, performing matrix multiplication, transposing a matric and doing a principal component analysis on the training and test data.

## Custom cropping tool:
We created a custom cropping tool in order to faciliate the creation of sample images from a given video file. It allows us to easily crop a portion of an image with predetermined width and height values.
